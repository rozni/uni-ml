# Cognitive Systems for Health Technology Applications


A [Metropolia University of Applied Sciences](https://www.metropolia.fi/) course about basics of artificial neural networks,
convolutional and recurrent neural networks, applications of neural networks in health technology and natural language processing applications.


This is a place where I keep my home assignments and collect other [public] materials related to the course.

Feel free to view the contents :-)
