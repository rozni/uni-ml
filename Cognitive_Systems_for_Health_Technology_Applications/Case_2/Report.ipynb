    "The dataset turned out to be a very challenging one. We struggled to find a model architecture which would train reasonably fast and would achieve good performance in terms of accuracy and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. We were trying to follow advice and guidelines of various sources, mainly the following:\n",

    "However, due to limited resources and large hyperparameter space we were unable to explore as many preprocessing and model pipelines as we intended. Most of our models performed close to random guessing and/or would always predict no symptoms.\n",

    "For the sake of better organization and clarity, we will only link chosen preprocessing steps and models instead of embedding them in this notebook."
